Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that: (A)&nbsp;the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity,

construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party&#146;s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C)&nbsp;the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without

or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security. </P>
