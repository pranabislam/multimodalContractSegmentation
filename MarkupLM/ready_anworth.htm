constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)&nbsp;and 856(c)(3)&nbsp;of
the Code or (2)&nbsp;Parent&rsquo;s outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by Parent of the
Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2)&nbsp;and 856(c)(3)&nbsp;of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Fee
to Parent. The Company agrees to amend this <I>Section&nbsp;8.3(j)</I>&nbsp;at the reasonable request of Parent in order to (x)&nbsp;maximize
that portion of the Termination Fee that may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2)&nbsp;and 856(c)(3)&nbsp;of the Code or (y)&nbsp;assist Parent in obtaining a favorable ruling from the IRS
or legal opinion from its outside counsel, in each case, as described in this <I>Section&nbsp;8.3(j)(ii)</I>. Any amount of the
Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitation of this <I>Section&nbsp;8.3(j)</I>.</FONT></P>

At its election, the Corporation, prior to a Redemption Date, may irrevocably deposit the redemption price (including accumulated
and unpaid dividends) of the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock so called for redemption in trust for the holders thereof with a bank
or trust company, in which case the redemption notice to holders of the shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock to be redeemed
shall (i)&nbsp;state the date of such deposit, (ii)&nbsp;specify the office of such bank or trust company as the place of payment
of the redemption price and (iii)&nbsp;require such holders to surrender the certificates representing such shares at such place
on or about the date fixed in such redemption notice (which may not be later than the Redemption Date) against payment of the redemption
price (including all accumulated and unpaid dividends to the Redemption Date). Any interest or other earnings earned on the redemption
price (including accumulated and unpaid dividends) deposited with a bank or trust company shall be paid to the Corporation. Any
monies so deposited which remain unclaimed by the holders of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock at the end of two years after the Redemption
Date shall be returned by such bank or trust company to the Corporation.</FONT></P>
